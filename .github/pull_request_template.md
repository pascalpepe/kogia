Hello,

Thanks for contributing to Kogia!

This project is free and open source, and contributions are very welcome.
The development of this project happens on
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/kogia) rather than

contributions.

You are only one step away! You can use your GitHub account to log in GitLab
and open a merge request so that your changes can become part of Kogia.

If in doubt, refer to the [contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/kogia/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thanks again for wanting to contribute to this project.
