## Reporting bugs

First, search [existing issues](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/kogia/-/issues)
to check whether the bug has already been reported.

If that's not the case, open a new issue with:

- [ ] A short and descriptive title.
- [ ] A longer description of the bug.
- [ ] A list of steps required to reproduce the bug.
- [ ] Additional information that might be relevant to the issue being described.

## Writing documentation and contributing source code

First, search [existing issues](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/kogia/-/issues)
and [merge requests](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/kogia/-/merge_requests)
to check whether your suggestion is already being worked on.

If that's not the case, please [submit a new issue](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/kogia/-/issues/new)
with:

- [ ] A short and descriptive title.
- [ ] A longer summary of what you plan on contributing.

After your suggestion is approved, and if you want to work on it yourself:

1. Fork and clone the project on GitLab.
2. Create a new branch dedicated to your work and prefix the branch name with
   the corresponding issue number. For example:

       git checkout -b 1234-short-descriptive-title

3. Push the branch with your work to your own repository.
4. [Create a merge request](https://gitlab.com/pascalpepe/kogia/-/merge_requests/new)
   to the upstream repository. All merge requests must target the main branch.
